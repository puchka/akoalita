# akoalita

Open library game engine for Fanorona game

## Getting Started

See Acknowledgments for further information about the game.<br><br>
Akoalita have two (android is not included) modules :<br>
* <b>core</b> : it's the game engine, you can use it independently without using the server module. We try to make it as generic as possible to facilitate its integration into other java/kotlin project.<br>
  Is there any Unit Testing for the core ? Yes, you can run it on mg.comteen.GameTU.java This help you to test and modify the core game without intergrating it.
* <b>server</b> : it's a poc/example module to illustrate the integration of the core module in a real project. 
* <b>android</b> : coming soon, an UI implementation using the core and server module.

We use this project for teaching programming as well.
